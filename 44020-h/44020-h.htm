<h3>DIVERSE AIMS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Early Morning</i>.)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Curate</i>. <span class="smcap">&quot;Yes, it&#39;s a lovely Morning, Trencherman;
just the sort to give one an Appetite for Breakfast.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Farmer Trencherman</i>. <span class="smcap">&quot;Ah! A Happitite for yer Breakfast,
Sir. Now there&#39;s the difference, yer see. I be come out
fur to get a Breakfast for my Happitite!&quot;</span></p>

<hr />

<h2>&quot;DUE SOUTH.&quot;</h2>

<p class="center"><i>A Trip round &quot;the Island,&quot; and back to P&#39;m&#39;th</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Happy Thought (on board crowded steamboat)</i>.&mdash;&quot;Obstinacy is
the best policy.&quot; The obstinate man won&#39;t move, and won&#39;t speak,
except in monosyllables; he won&#39;t budge one inch for anybody;
he puts everybody in a worse temper than everybody was before,
and, in the end, he wins. To the credit of the obstinate man be it
said that &quot;he knows how to keep his place,&quot; and does keep it too.</p>

<p class="indent">A kind of second-rate sporting bookmaker, with sandy whiskers
and dirty hands, who has secured a corner seat near me, smokes like
a chimney, and the chimney, his pipe, ought to have been swept and
cleaned out long ago. Also he seems quite unable to take five whiffs
without prolific expectoration. From experience I believe he will
be visited by the steward, and told not to smoke. I am awaiting
this with malicious anticipation of pleasure. I am disappointed. A
junior steward, of whom I make the inquiry in heating of the objectionable
fumigator, replies that &quot;Smoking <i>is</i> allowed here, but not
abaft.&quot; Thanks, very much. The sandy-whiskered man won&#39;t go
&quot;abaft,&quot; wherever that is. Perhaps he will presently. After a
time, when it becomes a bit rougher, he disappears. No doubt he
has gone &quot;abaft.&quot; Let him stay there.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>The Needles</i>.&quot;&mdash;Why needles? There&#39;s no more point in the
name than there is to the rocks.</p>

<p class="indent">Opposite Freshwater it very naturally commences to be a bit
freshish; some people in the forepart are getting very wet; there
is a stampede; it is still fresher and rougher; but I have every
confidence in the Captain, who, as I observe, is negligently standing
on the bridge, deliberately cracking specimens of that great
delicacy the early filbert, or it may be the still earlier walnut.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Happy Thought</i>.&mdash;There can be no danger when the Captain is
engaged in cracking nuts as if they were so many jokes.</p>

<p class="indent">Splashing and ducking have commenced freely. The waves do
the splashing, and the people on board do the ducking.</p>

<p class="indent">There are those who look ill and keep well; and others who look
well at first, but who turn all sorts of colours within a quarter of
an hour, struggle gallantly, and succumb; children lively, but
gradually collapsing, lying about doubled up helplessly; comfortable,
comely matrons who came on board neat and tidy, now horridly
uncomfortable, and quite reckless of appearance. Here, too,
is the uncertain sailor, who considers it safer to remain seated, and
who, at the end of the voyage, is surprised to find himself in
perfect health.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sighting Ventnor</i>.&mdash;The man &quot;who knows everything&quot; informs us
that this is Bonchurch, which information a man with a book has of
course felt himself bound to correct. The latter tells us that it is
a place called Undercliff (which nobody for one moment believes),
and both informants are put right by a mariner with a map, who
points out all the places correctly, and confides to us in a husky
voice that &quot;that ere place among the trees is Ventnor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">More shower-bathing; the fore-part of the vessel quite cleared
by the attacking waves.</p>

<p class="indent">However, &quot;it soon dries off,&quot; says a jolly middle-aged gentleman
in a summer suit, drenched from tip of collar to toe of boot.</p>

<p class="indent">Being well out at sea (how many are never &quot;<i>well</i> out at sea&quot;!),
we catch sight of Bonchurch and the landslip. Of course we gay
nautical dogs pity the poor lubbers ashore who &quot;live at home at
ease,&quot; and who are probably suffering from intense&mdash;&mdash; (Here
my remarks, made to a jovial companion on a camp-stool, are
interrupted by a blob in the eye from a wave. On recovery I
forget what I was going to say, but fancy &quot;the missing word&quot; is
&quot;heat.&quot;)</p>

<p class="indent">Passing Sandown. Of course the well-informed person says,
&quot;This is where the races are,&quot; and equally of course he is immediately
contradicted by a reduced chorus of bystanders, who pity
his deplorable ignorance. Total discomfiture of well-informed
person. He disappears. &quot;Gone below,&quot; like a Demon in a pantomime
at the appearance of the Good Fairy.</p>

<p class="indent">Nice place Sandown apparently, where, it being 1.30, the happy
Wight-islanders are probably sitting down in comfort to a nice hot
lunch, while we, the jovial mariners&mdash;well, no matter. I shall wait
till I can lunch ashore.</p>

<p class="indent">Our arrangements are to land at Southsea, where (so we were
given to understand) we ought to be at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> But already it
is 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and I dive into my provision-pocket for a broken biscuit. ... An interior voice whispers that the broken biscuit was a
mistake. I tremble. False alarm. Southsea!! Saved!! But we
are forty minutes late, and our time for refreshment is considerably
curtailed.</p>

<p class="indent">We crowd off through a sort of black-hole passage. Debarking and
re-embarking might be very easily managed on a much more
comfortable plan. We pay one penny for the pier-toll, and we
make for the hotel at the entrance to the pier. Any port in a
storm. Cold luncheon is ready for those who can take it, that is,
one in six.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Back again</i>.&mdash;Past Cowes and Ryde. Weather lovely; sea calm.</p>

<p class="indent">There are some persons of whom I would make short work were I
a Captain on board, with power to order into irons anyone whose
presence was objectionable. And these persons are, Firstly, stout
greasy women, with damp, dirty little children. Secondly, fat old
men and women (more or less dirty) eating green, juicy pears
with pocket knives. Thirdly, smokers of strong pipes. Fourthly,
smokers of cigars. Fifthly (imprisonment with torture), for smokers
of bad cigars. Sixthly, people who will persist in attempting to
walk about and who, in order to preserve their perpendicular, are
perpetually making grabs at everything and everybody. Seventhly,
aimless wanderers, who seem unable to remain in one place for five
minutes at a time.</p>

<p class="indent">5.45. Old England once more. We land on P&#39;m&#39;th Pier.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">&#39;Lux&#39; against Him</span>.&quot;&mdash;At the Church Congress last week the
gentleman known as &quot;Father <span class="smcap">Ignatius</span>,&quot; who evidently considers an
Ecclesiastical Congress at Birmingham a mere &quot;Brummagam
affair,&quot; became uncommonly excited. It cannot be said that his
violence took the form of demanding the blood of any antagonist, as
he distinctly objected to the presence of <i>Gore</i>. But Mr. <span class="smcap">Gore</span>, author
of <i>Lux Mundi</i>, won the toss, stood his ground, and spoke; his speech
being very favourably received. &quot;Yet,&quot; as the President remarked
(probably to himself, as it was not reported), &quot;we must
draw the line somewhere, and it is only a pity the <span class="smcap">Lyne</span> has been
&#39;drawn&#39; here.&quot; Subsequently the <span class="smcap">Lyne</span> shook hands with the
police, peace was restored, and the <span class="smcap">Lyne</span> lay down with the lamb.
&quot;See how these Christians love one another!&quot;</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="indent">Why is an utterly selfish man always a most presentable person in
the very best society?&mdash;<i>Ans</i>. Because never for one minute does he
forget himself.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>War!</i> Is it still to be war, wild war in the heart of the land?</p>
<p class="i2">Are we children of England, busied in tearing our mother&#39;s breast?</p>
<p>And is there no ruling counsel, and is there no warning hand</p>
<p class="i2">To bring this folly to reason, and still this fury to rest?</p>
<p><i>War!</i> And the boons of Nature are wasted in stubborn strife,</p>
<p class="i2">And women, children, non-combatants, suffer and starve and stand by;</p>
<p>And idle hands are lifted in vain for the means of life;</p>
<p class="i4">And <i>why</i>?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Ye will not list to each other, then listen to me and to <i>these</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">Whose mute appeal I must voice, and whose pitiful cause I must plead!</p>
<p>You of the hardened hearts playing autocrat much at your ease,</p>
<p class="i2">And you of the hardened hands who the <i>end</i> of the way little heed;</p>
<p>Listen and look and consider! The blows that you blindly strike</p>
<p class="i2">Like shafts that are shot at a venture, fall not alone upon foes.</p>
<p>The arrow shot o&#39;er the house<a name="FNanchor_A_A" id="FNanchor_A_A"></a>

<div class="stanza">
<p>While ten thousand innocent lives of <i>your</i> quarrel are bearing the brunt,</p>
<p class="i2">And a myriad hands hang idle because <i>you</i> are fiercely opposed.</p>
<p>Look at them! Gathered hungry about an empty grate.</p>
<p class="i2">Whilst the coal they crave lies idle within the unpeopled mine,</p>
<p>And Wealth and Work, at odds, when invited to arbitrate&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">Decline!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Capital sets its face, and cocks a contemptuous nose,</p>
<p class="i2">And Labour, lounging sullenly, snaps its jaws like a spring;</p>
<p>And the land must stand at gaze whilst they fight it out as foes!</p>
<p class="i2">How long must we wait the issue, how long must we &quot;keep the ring&quot;?</p>
<p>Are there no rights save yours, no claims save your warring wills?</p>
<p class="i2">Sense has a word to say, Justice a thing to do.</p>
<p>Are we to wait and wait while the land with suffering thrills,</p>
<p class="i4">For <i>you</i>?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Sympathy? Ay, good friends! But sympathy&#39;s not like wrath,</p>
<p class="i2">One-eyed, one-sided, partial. Sympathy&#39;s due to all</p>
<p>Who fall, fate-tripped and bruised, in your quarrel&#39;s Juggernaut path.</p>
<p class="i2">We think of the wives and children&mdash;Charity heeds their call;</p>
<p>Does she not proffer her dole &quot;without prejudice&quot;?&mdash;Yes, but they</p>
<p class="i2">Are not sole sufferers now from the Coal War&#39;s venomous strife.</p>
<p>Thousands of unknown hearts are pleading for Peace to-day&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">And <i>Life</i>!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Strong men &quot;out of work,&quot; weak women as &quot;out of heart,&quot;</p>
<p class="i2">Factory gates unopened, and Workhouse gates fast shut.</p>
<p>Traffic hampered, arrested, piled trains unable to start.</p>
<p class="i2">Famine in homes and hearths, trade dead-lock and market-glut!</p>
<p>The coal lies there in the mine, untouched of hammer and pick,</p>
<p class="i2">While yon pale widow-woman must haggle in vain for enough</p>
<p>To charge her tiny grate! Faith! the heart that turns not sick</p>
<p class="i4">Is tough!</p>

<p>Tough, my lords of Capital! Hard as the coal-seam black</p>

<p>The wealth the sunlight stored men hew for you in the dark,</p>
<p class="i2">From the black and poisonous caverns which once were forests free,</p>

<p>The crowd of want-urged captives shackled to Mammon&#39;s car,</p>
<p class="i2">Show not the welcomest things to this curious, questioning age.</p>
<p>To-day the appeal&#39;s to Pity. To-morrow&mdash;well, never mind!&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Look on the sorrowful picture that <i>Punch</i> commends to your view!</p>
<p>Man many a time has found there is wisdom in being kind.</p>

<p class="i2">But when in your stubborn wrath you swear it is &quot;war to the knife,&quot;</p>
<p>Remember that knife&#39;s at the throat of others than those who&#39;d gain</p>
<p class="i2">By a victory for you in this fiercest of labour fights.</p>

<h2>RIPPIN&#39;.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Song of the Modern Masher</i>.)</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh! other centuries have had their blades, their bucks, their dandies,</p>
<p>Who had redeeming qualities, but what no man can stand is</p>
<p>The up-to-date variety, that miserable nonny,</p>
<p>The self-conceited jackanapes who calls himself a &quot;Johnny.&quot;</p>
<p>He hasn&#39;t got the brawn or brains to go in for excesses,</p>
<p>His faults are feeble&mdash;like himself,&mdash;he dawdles, dines, and dresses,</p>
<p>His words, his hair, his silly speech to sheer negation clippin&#39;,</p>
<p>And when he wants to praise a thing, his only word is &quot;Rippin&#39;.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>Chorus</i>.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Oh! he&#39;s rippin&#39;, rippin&#39;! A tailor&#39;s block set skippin&#39;,</p>
<p class="i2">He&#39;s all bad debts and cigarettes and bets and kümmel-nippin&#39;,</p>
<p class="i2">His head&#39;s without a grain of sense, his hand he&#39;s got no grip in,</p>
<p class="i2">He drags his walk and tags his talk with &quot;Rippin&#39;, rippin&#39;, rippin&#39;&quot;!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>His faultless dress is the result of unremitting study,</p>
<p>He&#39;s quite the perfect &quot;Johnny,&quot; never messed and never muddy,</p>
<p>His coat is always baggy and his hat is always shiny,</p>
<p>His boots are always varnished to their pointed toes so tiny.</p>
<p>His shirts, his ties, his walking-sticks are marvels to remember,</p>
<p>And with the seasons change from January to December.</p>
<p>He always wears a &quot;buttonhole,&quot; and in a huge carnation</p>
<p>Of hideous hue &#39;twixt green and blue finds special delectation.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>He has a language of his own which he elects to talk in;</p>
<p>He cuts his final g&#39;s and speaks of shootin&#39;, huntin&#39;, walkin&#39;;</p>
<p>With slipshod phrase and hybrid slang his speeches fairly bristle,</p>
<p>And vulgarisms &quot;smart&quot; he loves as donkeys love a thistle.</p>
<p>He&#39;ll lay &quot;a hun<i>derd</i> poun<i>d</i>,&quot; or say &quot;he ain&#39;t,&quot; quite uncompunctive;</p>
<p>He systematically spurns the use of the subjunctive.</p>
<p>He knows &quot;how the best people talk,&quot; and quite ignores the clamour</p>
<p>Of any &quot;dash&#39;d low nonsense,&quot; such as euphony and grammar.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>He&#39;s great upon the music-halls, can tell you what befalls there;</p>
<p>He drops in at the Gaiety, and ornaments the stalls there;</p>
<p>He knows each vapid joke by heart, and wishes that he knew more;</p>
<p>They quite conform in quality to <i>his</i> idea of humour.</p>
<p>He skims the sportin&#39; papers, and devours the shillin&#39; thriller;</p>
<p>He counts the bard of comic songs a cut above a <span class="smcap">Schiller</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>In fact, they scoff at poets in his very wide-awake sphere,</p>
<p>And in his secret soul he has a fine contempt for <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>He dawdles dully through his day in quite the latest fashion&mdash;</p>
<p>A round of folly minus wit, and vice without its passion.</p>
<p>At five he walks &quot;the Burlington,&quot; in which esteemed Arcade he</p>
<p>Meets various of his chosen chums&mdash;the silly and the shady;</p>
<p>Then to the Berkeley or Savoy at eight o&#39;clock or later,</p>
<p>Much over-dressed, to over-dine, and over-tip the waiter.</p>
<p>The theatre next, and last his club (the which he takes delight in),</p>
<p>To prove his pluck by &quot;lookin&#39; on at other Johnnies fightin&#39;.&quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>His conversation&#39;s all made up of stable and of scandal,</p>
<p>And tales of &quot;chaps he knows&quot;&mdash;whose names have mostly got a &quot;handle.&quot;</p>
<p>He &quot;don&#39;t go in&quot; for ladies much, their style of charm is <i>not</i> his,</p>
<p>Which follows on the model of the &quot;Lotties&quot; and the &quot;Totties.&quot;</p>
<p>He doesn&#39;t sing, he doesn&#39;t dance, he has no recreation</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t sap his scanty brains or sear his reputation,</p>
<p>In short,&mdash;for him, his antics and his never-ceasin&#39; &quot;rippin&#39;,&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s just one cure would answer, and that&#39;s whippin&#39;, whippin&#39;, whippin&#39;.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">

<h2>UNDER THE ROSE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Story in Scenes</i>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
SCENE VIII.&mdash;<i>A prettily-furnished Drawing-room at the</i> <span class="smcap">Merridews&#39;</span>
<i>House in Hans Place</i>. <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About 5.30 on Saturday afternoon</i>.
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Merridew</span> <i>has a small tea-table in front of her</i>.
<span class="smcap">Althea</span> <i>is sitting on a couch close by</i>. <i>Both ladies are wearing
their hats, having just returned from a drive</i>. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Merridew</span>
<i>is young and attractive, and her frock is in the latest fashion</i>;
<span class="smcap">Althea</span> <i>is more simply dressed, though her hair and toilette
have evidently been supervised by an experienced maid</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Merridew</i>. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever known the Park so full
before Easter as it was to-day. Try one of those hot cakes, <span class="smcap">Thea</span>,
or a jam sandwich&mdash;we don&#39;t dine till late, you know. It&#39;s been so
nice having you, I do wish you hadn&#39;t to go on Monday&mdash;<i>must</i> you?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Althea</i>. I&#39;m afraid I must, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>; it has been the most delightful
week; only&mdash;Clapham will seem dreadfully flat after all this. <i>She sighs</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. Notwithstanding the excitement of Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew&#39;s</span> conversation?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew</span>, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. Now don&#39;t pretend ignorance, dear. You have quoted
Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew</span> and his opinions often enough to show that you see
and think a good deal of him. And, really, if you colour like that
at the mere mention&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. Am I colouring? That last cup was so strong. And I
don&#39;t see Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew</span> at
all often. He is more
Mamma&#39;s friend than mine&mdash;she
has a very high
opinion of him.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. I daresay he
deserves it. He&#39;s a fearfully
learned and superior
person, isn&#39;t he?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. I&mdash;I don&#39;t know.
He writes for the paper.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. That&#39;s vague,
dear. What sort of paper?
Political, Scientific, Sporting,
Society&mdash;or what?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. I never asked;
but I should think&mdash;well,
he&#39;s rather <i>serious</i>, you
know, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. Then it&#39;s a
comic paper, my dear, depend
upon it!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. Oh, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>, I&#39;m
<i>sure</i> it isn&#39;t. And he&#39;s
very hardworking. He&#39;s
not like most men of his
age, he doesn&#39;t care in the
least for amusements.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. He must be a
very lively person. But tell me&mdash;you used to tell me everything,
<span class="smcap">THEA</span>&mdash;does this immaculate paragon show any signs of&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. (<i>in a low voice</i>). I&#39;m not sure&mdash;&mdash;Perhaps&mdash;but I may be
mistaken.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. And if&mdash;don&#39;t think me horribly impertinent&mdash;but if
you&#39;re <i>not</i> mistaken, have you made up your mind what answer to
give him?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. (<i>imploringly</i>). Don&#39;t tease me, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>. I thought once&mdash;but
now I really don&#39;t know. I wish he wasn&#39;t so strict and severe.
I wish he understood that one can&#39;t always be solemn&mdash;that one
must have a little enjoyment in one&#39;s life, when one is young!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. And yet I seem to remember a girl who had serious
searchings of heart, not so very long ago, as to whether it wasn&#39;t
sinful to go and see <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> at the Lyceum!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. I know; it was silly of me&mdash;but I didn&#39;t know what a
theatre was like. I&#39;d never been to see a play&mdash;not even at the
Crystal Palace. But now I&#39;ve been, I&#39;d like to go to one every
week; they&#39;re lovely, and I don&#39;t believe anything that makes you
cry and laugh like that <i>can</i> be wicked!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. Ah, you were no more meant to be a little Puritan than
I was myself, dear. Heavens! When I think what an abominable
prig I must have been at Miss <span class="smcap">Pruins&#39;</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. You weren&#39;t in the least a prig, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>. But you <i>were</i>
different. You used to say you intended to devote yourself entirely
to Humanity.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. Yes; but I didn&#39;t realise then what a lot there were
of them. And when I met <span class="smcap">Frank</span> I thought it would be less
ambitious to begin with <i>him</i>. Now I find there&#39;s humanity enough
in <span class="smcap">Frank</span> to occupy the devotion of a lifetime. But are you
sure, <span class="smcap">Thea</span>, that this journalist admirer of yours is quite the man
to&mdash;&mdash; He sounds dull, dear; admirable and all that&mdash;but, oh, so
deadly dull!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
<a href="images/172.png"><img width="100%" src="images/172.png" alt=""/></a>

<p class="center">&quot;Yes; but I didn&#39;t realise then what a lot there were of them.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. If he was brilliant and fond of excitement <i>we</i> shouldn&#39;t
have known him; for we&#39;re deadly dull ourselves, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>. I never
knew <i>how</i> dull till&mdash;till I came to stay with you!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. You&#39;re not dull, you&#39;re a darling; and if you think I&#39;m
going to let you throw yourself away on some humdrum plodder who
will expect you to find your sole amusement in hearing him prose,
you&#39;re mistaken; because I shan&#39;t. <span class="smcap">Thea</span>, whatever you do, don&#39;t
be talked into marrying a Dryasdust; you&#39;ll only be miserable if
you do!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. But Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew</span> isn&#39;t as bad as that, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>. And&mdash;and
he hasn&#39;t asked me yet, and when he finds out how frivolous
I&#39;ve become, very likely he never will; so we needn&#39;t talk about it
any more, need we?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. Now I feel snubbed; but I don&#39;t care, it&#39;s all for your
good, my dear, and I&#39;ve said all I wanted to, so we&#39;ll change the
subject for something more amusing. (Colonel <span class="smcap">Merridew</span> <i>comes in</i>.)
Well, <span class="smcap">Frank</span>, have you actually condescended to come in for some
tea? (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Althea</span>.) Generally he says tea is all very well for
women; and then goes off to his club and has at least two cups, and
I daresay muffins.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Col. M</i>. Why not say ham-sandwiches at once, <span class="smcap">Cecilia</span>, my dear?
pity to curb your imagination! (<i>Sitting down</i>.) If that tea&#39;s
drinkable, I don&#39;t know that I won&#39;t have a cup; though it&#39;s not
what I came for. I wanted to know if you&#39;d settled to do anything
this evening, because, if not, I&#39;ve got a suggestion&mdash;struck me in
the Row just after you&#39;d
passed, and I thought I&#39;d
come back and see how <i>you</i>
felt about it. (<i>He takes his
tea</i>.) For me?&mdash;thanks.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. We feel curious
about it at present. <span class="smcap">Frank</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Col. M</i>. Well, I thought
that, as this is Miss
<span class="smcap">Toovey&#39;s</span> last evening with
us, it was a pity to waste it
at home. Why shouldn&#39;t
we have a little dinner at
the Savoy, eh?&mdash;about
eight&mdash;and drop in somewhere
afterwards, if we
feel inclined?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. Do you know
that&#39;s quite a delightful
idea of yours, <span class="smcap">Frank</span>.
That is, unless <span class="smcap">Thea</span> has
had enough of gaiety, and
would rather we had a
quiet evening. Would
you, dear? <i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Althea</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. (<i>eagerly</i>). Oh, no,
indeed, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>, I&#39;m not a
bit tired!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. You&#39;re quite
sure? But where could we go on afterwards, <span class="smcap">Frank</span>; shouldn&#39;t
we be too late for any theatre?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Col. M</i>. I rather thought we might look in at the Eldorado; you
said you were very keen to hear <span class="smcap">Walter Wildfire</span>. (<i>He perceives
that his wife is telegraphing displeasure</i>.) Eh? why, you <i>did</i> want
me to take you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. (<i>to herself</i>). <span class="smcap">Walter Wildfire</span>? why, it was <span class="smcap">Walter
Wildfire</span> that <span class="smcap">Charles</span> advised Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew</span> to go and hear.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew</span> said it was the very last thing he was likely to do.
But he&#39;s so prejudiced!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. (<i>trying to make her husband understand</i>). Some time&mdash;but
I think, not to-night, <span class="smcap">Frank</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Col. M</i>. If it&#39;s not to-night you mayn&#39;t get another chance;
they say he&#39;s going to give up singing very soon.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. Oh, I hope not! I remember now hearing he was going
to retire, because his throat was weak, or else he was going into
Parliament, or a Retreat, or something or other. But I&#39;m sure,
<span class="smcap">Frank</span>, <span class="smcap">Althea</span> wouldn&#39;t quite like to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Col. M</i>. Then of course there&#39;s no more to be said. I only
thought she might be amused, you know.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. But indeed I should, Colonel <span class="smcap">Merridew</span>, please let us go!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. But, <span class="smcap">Thea</span>, dear, are you sure you quite understand
what the Eldorado <i>is</i>?&mdash;it&#39;s a music-hall. Of course it&#39;s all right,
and everyone goes nowadays; but, still, I shouldn&#39;t like to take you
if there was any chance that your mother might disapprove. You
might never be allowed to come to us again.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. (<i>to herself</i>). They&#39;re both dying to go, I can see; it&#39;s too
hateful to feel oneself such a kill-joy! And even Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew</span>
admitted that a music-hall was no worse than a Penny Reading.
(<i>Aloud</i>.) I don&#39;t think Mamma would disapprove, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>; not more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
than she would of my going to theatres, and I&#39;ve been to <i>them</i>, you
know!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Col. M</i>. We&#39;d have a box, of course, and only just get there in
time to hear <span class="smcap">Wildfire</span>; we could go away directly afterwards, &#39;pon
my word, <span class="smcap">Cecilia</span>, I don&#39;t see any objection, if Miss <span class="smcap">Toovey</span> would
like to go. Never heard a word against <span class="smcap">Wildfire&#39;s</span> singing, and as
for the rest, well, you admitted last time there was no real harm in
the thing!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. Do say yes, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>. I do want to hear this <span class="smcap">Walter
Wildfire</span> so!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. I&#39;m not at all sure that I ought to say anything of the
sort, but there&mdash;I&#39;ll take the responsibility.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Col. M</i>. Then that&#39;s settled. We&#39;ll take great care of you, Miss
<span class="smcap">Toovey</span>. I&#39;ll just go down to the Rag, <span class="smcap">Cecilia</span>, and send out to get
a box. I&#39;ll see if I can find someone to make a fourth, and I daresay
we shall manage to amuse ourselves.    [<i>He goes out</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. <span class="smcap">Thea.</span> I really don&#39;t feel quite happy about this. I
think I&#39;ll go after <span class="smcap">Frank</span> and tell him not to get that box
after all; he won&#39;t have left the house yet.      [<i>She attempts to rise</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. No, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>, you mustn&#39;t, if it&#39;s on my account. I won&#39;t let
you!      [<i>She holds her back</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. M</i>. But, <span class="smcap">Thea</span>, think. How would you like this Mr.
<span class="smcap">Curphew</span> to know that&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Alth</i>. (<i>releasing her suddenly</i>). Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew</span>! What does it
matter to me what Mr. <span class="smcap">Curphew</span>&mdash;&mdash;? ... There, Colonel
<span class="smcap">Merridew</span> has gone, <span class="smcap">Cissie</span>, I heard the door shut. It&#39;s too late&mdash;and
I&#39;m glad of it. We shall go to the Eldorado and hear
<span class="smcap">Walter Wildfire</span> after all!      [<span class="smcap">End of Scene VIII</span>.</p>

unite in their hundreds to petition &quot;the authorities&quot; (mysterious

<h2>THE RULES OF THE RUDE.</h2>

<p class="indent">1. The one object which all cyclists
should keep steadily in view is to become
&quot;scorchers.&quot; There are three
essentials before you can earn this proud
title. First, you must totally disregard
the convenience or safety of the public.
Second, you must ride at a minimum
rate of 15 miles an hour. Third, you
must develop pronounced curvature of
the spine as quickly as is compatible
with your other engagements.</p>

<p class="indent">2. Races should always be held on
the high roads, at a time of the day
when traffic is busiest.</p>

<p class="indent">3. Should you be unfortunate enough
to knock down a pedestrian, do not
trouble to stop and apologise, or inquire
if he&#39;s hurt. It is his business to get
out of your way, and you should remind
him of this obligation in the most forcible
language at your disposal. This
will tend to make the pastime exceedingly
popular among non-cyclists.</p>

<p class="indent">4. If you notice an old gentleman;
crossing the road, wait till you get
quite close to him, then emit a wild
war-whoop, blow your trumpet, and

happens to be walking in the middle
of the road, and going in your own
direction, is <i>not</i> to signal your approach
at all, but to startle him into fits by
suddenly and silently gliding by him
when he believes himself to be quite
alone. The nearer you can shave his
person the better the sport.</p>

<p class="indent">6. Of course the last plan is much
improved if the wayfarer should be a
market woman carrying milk or eggs,
and if in her fright she drops her can
or basket. Unfortunately few cyclists
have the good fortune to witness this
exquisite bit of rural comedy.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>An Exercise to be Translated from

<p class="indent">This is a thoroughly British home.
I find chairs, sofas, curtains, and carpets.
They all seem to be of British
manufacture.</p>

<p class="indent">No, they are not of British manufacture.
On the contrary, they are all
made in Germany.</p>

<p class="indent">But surely this window is English?
No, it is not English; it is put together
in Sweden, and erected by Swiss
workmen.</p>

<p class="indent">But are not these pictures, these
fire-irons, these card-tables, of home
growth? No, for the pictures come from
France, the fire-irons from Belgium,
and the card-tables from Austria.</p>

<p class="indent">The sofa, however, was surely bought
in London? It may have been bought
in London, but it was certainly made
in Denmark.</p>

<p class="indent">But the brass nails mast have arrived
from Sheffield? No, they are now received
from parts of Portugal, Spain,
and Northern Russia.</p>

<p class="indent">And the coal-scuttles, surely they
are made in Lambeth, Manchester, and
Liverpool? They were manufactured
in those places for a while, when other
branches of trade were lost to the
country, but for a long time they have
been imported from Constantinople.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be assumed that the coals
come from Newcastle? Certainly not,
considering that they have only just
been received from New York.</p>

<p class="indent">Are the bread and butter, and the
other ingredients of the tea-table,
English? Oh dear no; the toast comes
from Australia, the tea from Ceylon,
the sugar from the South Pole, and the
butter from Gibraltar.</p>

<p class="indent">It really would appear that there is
nothing English about the house;
nothing save the rent and taxes, which
of course are of home growth? You
are correct in your supposition; however,
in exchange for these conveniences
from abroad, we have made
a present to the foreigner of something
once held very dear in this country.</p>

<p class="indent">And what was that?</p>

<p class="indent">Our trade. English trade has left
England, probably permanently, for

<h2>BOBO.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>The kind of Novel Society likes</i>.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sling me over a two-eyed steak, <span class="smcap">Bill</span>,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Bill</span> complied instantly, for he knew the lady&#39;s style of conversation;
but Lord <span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span> required to be told that his Marchioness
was asking for one of the bloaters in the silver dish in front of his
cousin, <span class="smcap">Bill Splinter</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, dear reader, I &#39;m not going to describe Cokaleek House, in
the black country, or <span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>, or <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>, or <span class="smcap">Bill</span>. If you are in
smart society you know all about them beforehand; and if you ain&#39;t
you must puzzle them out the best way you can. The more I don&#39;t
describe them the more vivid and alive they ought to seem
to you. As for <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>, I shall let her talk. That&#39;s enough. In the
course of my two volumes&mdash;one thick and one thin&mdash;which is a new
departure, and looks as if my publisher thought that <span class="smcap">Bobo</span> would
stretch to three volumes, and then found she wouldn&#39;t&mdash;you will be
told, 1, that <span class="smcap">Bobo</span> had brown eyes; 2, that she was five foot eight;
and that is all you &#39;ll ever know about the outside of <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>. But
you&#39;ll hear her talk, and you&#39;ll see her smoke; and if you can&#39;t
evolve a fascinating personality out of cigarettes, and swears, and
skittish conversation, you are not worthy to have known <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">I am told that some people have taken &quot;<span class="smcap">Bobo</span>&quot; for a vulgar
caricature of a real personage. If they have, I can only say I feel
flattered by the notion, as it may serve to differentiate me from the
vulgar herd of novelists who draw on their
imagination for their characters.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span> (<i>and others</i>).</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Bobo</span> began her bloater.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why the beast has a hard roe!&quot; she
cried. &quot;<span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>, you shall have the roe;&quot;
and she dropped it into his tea before he could
object. &quot;You&#39;re not eating any breakfast.
Put the mustard-spoon in his mouth, <span class="smcap">Bill</span>, if
he insists upon keeping it wide open while he
stares at me. Ain&#39;t I fascinating this morning?
Why the devil don&#39;t you notice the new
feather in my hat? I always wear feathers
when I&#39;m going out clubbing, because I
plume myself upon being smart. Here, somebody
see if my spur&#39;s screwed on all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish your head was screwed on half as
well,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Bill</span>, as <span class="smcap">Bobo</span> planted her handsome
Pinet boot, No. 31z, on the breakfast-table.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span> looked on and smiled, with his
mouth still open. It was all he had to do
in life. He had married her because she was
<span class="smcap">Bobo</span>; and the more she out-Bobo&#39;d <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>,
the better she pleased him. He was a marquis,
and a millionaire, but he had only one drawing-room
at his country-seat; and the
smoking-room was upstairs&mdash;obviously because
there was no room for it on the ground-floor.
And there was only one piano in the
house, at which <span class="smcap">Bobo&#39;s</span> gifted young friend,
<span class="smcap">Sallie Rengaw</span>, was engaged in the early
morning, picking out an original funeral
march with one finger, and throwing breakfast-eggs
about in the fury of inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">An <i>&oelig;uf à la coque</i> came flying across
the passage at this moment, through the
open door of the dining-room, and hit <span class="smcap">Bill
Splinter</span> on the nose. <span class="smcap">Bill</span> was <span class="smcap">Cokaleek&#39;s</span>
first-cousin, and heir-presumptive; in love,
<i>pour le bon motif</i>, with <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You should always give <span class="smcap">Sallie</span> poached
eggs,&quot; he remonstrated, holding his nose;
&quot;they make a worse mess when she pitches
them about, but they only hurt the furniture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does she always chuck eggs?&quot; asked
<span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>, mildly.</p>

<p class="indent">It was <span class="smcap">Bobo&#39;s</span> first autumn at Cokaleek
House, and the Marquis wasn&#39;t used to the
ways of her gifted friends. She had another
friend, besides the musical lady, a Miss
<span class="smcap">Miranda Skeggs</span>, whose conversation was
like a bad dream; and these two, with
<span class="smcap">Bill Splinter</span>, were the house-party.
<span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>, waking suddenly from an after-dinner
nap, used to think he was in Hanwell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She chucks anything,&quot; answered <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>;
&quot;kidneys, chops, devilled bones. How can
she help it? That&#39;s the divine afflatus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It <i>sounds</i> like ta-ra-ra-boomdeay,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>, who
thought his wife meant the melody that <span class="smcap">Sallie&#39;s</span> muscular forefinger
was thumping out on the concert-grand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, come along, every manjack of you!&quot; shrieked <span class="smcap">Sallie</span>,
from the other side of the passage. &quot;Ain&#39;t this glorious? Ain&#39;t it
majestic? Don&#39;t it bang <span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>, and knock <span class="smcap">Sullivan</span> into a
cocked-hat? Hark at this! Ta-ra-ra! <i>largo</i>, for the hautboys
and first fiddles. Boom! cornets and ophicleides. De&mdash;&mdash;ay!
bassoons, double-basses, and minute-guns on the big drum. There&#39;s
a funeral march for you! With my learned orchestration it will be
as good as <span class="smcap">Sebastian Bach</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back? Why he&#39;s never been here in my time,&quot; faltered
<span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>. &quot;I don&#39;t know any feller called <span class="smcap">Sebastian</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rippin&#39;!&quot; cried <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>; &quot;and now we&#39;ll have the funeral. Get
all the cloaks and umbrellas off the stand, <span class="smcap">Miranda</span>. <span class="smcap">Bill</span>, bring
me the coal-scuttle&mdash;that&#39;s for the coffin, doncherknow. <span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>,
you and <span class="smcap">Bill</span> are to be a pair of black horses; and me and <span class="smcap">Miranda</span> &#39;ll
be the mourners. Play away, <span class="smcap">Sallie</span>, with all your might. We&#39;re
doing the funeral.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Out flew <span class="smcap">Bobo</span> into the garden, driving <span class="smcap">Bill</span> and <span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>
before her, scattering coals all over the gravel walk, and slashing at
the two men with her pocket-handkerchief. She rushed all round
the house, past the windows of the back parlour, kitchen, and
scullery; and then she suddenly remembered the cub-hunting, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
tore off to the stables, tally-ho-ing to <span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span> and <span class="smcap">Bill</span> to follow
her. The next thing they all saw was a shower of baking-pears
tumbling off the garden-wall, as <span class="smcap">Bobo</span> took it on her favourite hunter.
She had been essentially <span class="smcap">Bobo</span> all that morning.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIII.</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Bill</span>,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>, one winter twilight, by the smoking-room fire,
after her fourteenth cigarette, &quot;I want you to run away with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rot,&quot; answered <span class="smcap">Bill</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do. I&#39;ve ordered the carriage for half-past ten this
evening. We shall catch the mail to Euston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won&#39;t catch this male,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Bill</span>. &quot;No, <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>, you&#39;re
very good fun&mdash;in your own house, but I don&#39;t want you in mine.
You are distinctly <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>, but that&#39;s all. It isn&#39;t enough to live
upon. It won&#39;t pay rent and taxes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a cur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I&#39;m trying to be a gentleman. Besides, what&#39;s the matter
with <span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>? Hasn&#39;t he millions, and a charming house in the
heart of the collieries?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s all that&#39;s delightful, only I happen to hate him. Directly I
leave off chaffing him I begin to think of arsenic, and, brilliant as I am,
I can&#39;t coruscate all day. It&#39;s very mean of you not to want to elope.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I daresay; but I&#39;m the only rational being in the book, and
I want to sustain my character.&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapter the Last.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Bobo</span> stayed, and <span class="smcap">Bill</span> went in the carriage that had been ordered
for the elopement; and then there happened an incident so rare in
the realms of fiction that it has stamped my novel at once and for
ever as the work of an original mind.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span>, the noble, unappreciated husband, got himself killed
in the hunting-field. He went out with <span class="smcap">Bobo</span> one morning, and she
came home, a little earlier than usual, without him, and smoked
cigarettes by the fire, while he stayed out in the dusk and just
meekly rolled over a hedge, with his horse uppermost. He wasn&#39;t
like <span class="smcap">Guy Livingstone</span>; he wasn&#39;t a bit like dozens of heroes of
French novels, who have died the same kind of death. He was just
as absolutely <span class="smcap">Cokaleek</span> as his wife was <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">And did <span class="smcap">Bill</span> marry <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>, or <span class="smcap">Bobo</span> <span class="smcap">Bill</span>?</p>

<p class="indent">Not she! Another woman might have done it&mdash;but not <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>.
She knew too well what the intelligent reader expected of her; so
she jilted <span class="smcap">Bill</span>, in a thoroughly cold-blooded and <span class="smcap">Bobo</span>-ish manner,
and got herself married to an Austrian Prince at half-an-hour&#39;s
notice, by special licence from the A. of C.</p>

being limited to a certain number of representations. Rarely has a
scene of more fairy-like beauty been placed on the stage than <i>Maid

Forest. The peculiar light in
which the fairies appear gives a
marvellous elfinesque effect to the

both as tenor and actor. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bourchier</span>
is an easy-going representative
of the <span class="smcap">Earl of Huntingdon</span>,
with just enough suggestion of
&quot;divilment&quot; in his face to account
for his so readily and naturally
taking to robbery as a profession.</p>

<p class="indent">As <i>Maid Marian</i>, Miss <span class="smcap">Ada
Rehan</span> is at once dignified yet
playful, and as Tennysonianly
captivating in her boy&#39;s clothes
(there were ready-made tailors
to hand in the days of <span class="smcap">Isaac</span> of
York), which is of course &quot;<i>a
suit of male</i>,&quot; as she is when, as
<i>Rosalind</i>, she delights us in her doublet and hose. Fortunate is
Tailor-<i>Maid Marian</i> to obtain a situation in the country where so
many &quot;followers are allowed&quot;! <i>Little John</i>, <i>Will Scarlet</i>, <i>Old
Much</i> who does little, but that little well, with many others, make
up the aforesaid &quot;followers,&quot; who are of course very fond of chasing
every little dear they see among the
greenwood trees. Miss <span class="smcap">Catherine
Lewis</span> as <i>Kate</i>, with a song, one
of Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur&#39;s</span> extra good ones,
about a Bee (is it in the key of
&quot;B,&quot; for Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> dearly loves
a merrie jest?), obtained a hearty
encore on the first night. Not
only her singing of the bee song is
good, but her stage-buzzyness is
excellent.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. <span class="smcap">Hann&#39;s</span> (&#39;<span class="smcap">Arry</span> thinks
there&#39;s a &quot;lady scene-painter &#39;ere,
and her name is <span class="smcap">Hann</span>&quot;) and
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ryan&#39;s</span> scenery is first-rate;
and if the business of the fighting
were more realistic, if the three
Friars were a trifle less pantomimic,
and the three grotesquely-got-up
beggars (worthy of <span class="smcap">Callot&#39;s</span>
pencil) would aim at being
less actively funny, with one or
two other &quot;ifs,&quot; including <i>Friar
Tuck&#39;s</i> general make-up which
might be vastly improved, and if
the last Act were shortened, and
the Abbot and the Sheriff and the
Justiciary were compressed into
one, or abolished,&mdash;any of which
alterations may have been effected
by now, seeing the piece was produced just a week ago,&mdash;then the
attractions of <i>Maid Marian</i> and the fairy scene and the music are
of themselves sufficient to draw all lovers of the poetic musical
drama to Daly&#39;s for some weeks to come, unless Mr. <span class="smcap">Daly</span> clips the
run with the scissors of managerial fate,</p>
